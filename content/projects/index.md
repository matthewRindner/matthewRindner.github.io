## WORK IN PROGRESS

## [Bouldering Routes ratings](https://github.com/matthewRindner/passion_rock)
The goal is re-grade bouldering routes using the V# (V0-V10) scale by the type of each rock holds in a given route. OpenCV is used to extract the rock from an image using edge detection and image processing. 
Pytorch will be used to train a model in 5 classifications of common boulder holds: Pockets, Slopers, Crimps, Jugs, and Footholds.

This project will allow new ways to train climbers and help introduce new climbers with strategy/technique as well as rationalize the ratings assigned to routes and increase rating accuracy based on the intrinsic difficulty of the holds per route.
