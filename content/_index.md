My name is Matthew Rindner and I recently graduated from the University of Pittsburgh.  I am a Computer Science Major and Mathematics minor and am seeking opportunities to expand my professional experience as a developer. I have a passion to learn and aim for the top. 

<!-- I currently work at COMPANY_NAME as a SWE using TOOLS_TECHNONGY_TOPICS on a daily basis. -->

 <!-- I like to document some of the interesting things I have learned lately in my [blog](/blog/). -->

I plan on pursuing research in ML/AI and Web architecture to advance my skills in software engineering.

<!-- Hi! I am a PhD candidate studying the spintronic aspects of topological materials at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/), including novel nonlinear transport phenomena, spin-charge conversion, etc. In addition to my current [research](/research/), I also have broad interests in emerging fields of science and technology, particularly quantum computing. I like to document some of the interesting things I have learned lately in my [blog](/blog/). -->
